Bombe 0.4.0
===========

Bombe 0.4 has been developed with renewal in mind, keeping our codebase clean and light
for our consumers.

## Modularisation

Bombe has undergone modularisation, splitting the core project (previously `bombe`) into
logical, interconnected modules. This allows our dependants to be more selective about
which parts of Bombe they actually require.

There are now the following modules:
- `bombe-type` - The JVMS type model
- `bombe-analysis` - Our inheritance model
- `bombe-jar` - Bombe's jar transformation model
- `bombe-asm` - Implementations of some Bombe classes on ASM
